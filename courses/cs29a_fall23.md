# Lesson Notes
We will provide notes on each lesson below.

## Lesson 1 Thu 8/31/2023  _Intro and overview_
* We begin with
  - an overview of the course and
  - a discussion of why Math might be useful in CS, and what kinds of math would be most useful
* We ask everyhone to connect to the [Mastery Learning App](https://mastery.cs.brandeis.edu) with PIN 5074577
* We introduce Boolean Algebra and the Propositional Calculus  
  - We introduce the boolean operators AND, OR, NOT, IMPLIES, IFF, XOR, ONLYIF
    https://github.com/tjhickey724/discrete_math/blob/main/notes/propositional_calculus/overview.md
  - We also show how to create Truth Tables from Boolean formulas, i.e. sentences in the Propositional Calculus
  https://github.com/tjhickey724/discrete_math/blob/main/notes/propositional_calculus/TruthTablePractice.md
  - We get some practice in converting between English and the Propoaitional Calculus

# Homework
Most of our readings will come from two online books:
* Discrete Math: An Open Intorduction by Oscar Levin, abbreviated DM-AOI
  available at https://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3/dmoi.html
* Mathematics for Computer Science (from MIT) abbereviated as MTCS
  available at as a pdf at https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-spring-2015/mit6_042js15_textbook.pdf
  or in an online form as https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-spring-2015/pages/readings/

### Week 1 - due Monday 9/4/2023 before class
Read the following sections of two online books on Discrete Math
* DM-AOI Ch 0.2 http://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3/sec_intro-statements.html
* DM-AOI Ch 3.1 http://discrete.openmathbooks.org/dmoi3/sec_propositional.html
* MfCS Ch3.1-3.5
and try some of the problems at the end of the sections. We will go over some of them in class on Monday.

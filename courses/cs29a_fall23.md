# Lesson Notes
We will provide notes on each lesson below.

## Lesson 1 Thu 8/31/2023
Intro and overview.
* We begin with an overview of the course and a discussion of why Math might be useful in CS, and what kinds of math would be most useful
* Next we introduce Boolean Algebra and the Propositional Calculus
  https://github.com/tjhickey724/discrete_math/blob/main/notes/propositional_calculus/overview.md
* We introduce the boolean operators AND, OR, NOT, IMPLIES, IFF, XOR, ONLYIF
* We also show how to create Truth Tables from Boolean formulas, i.e. sentences in the Propositional Calculus
* We get some practice in converting between English and the Propoaitional Calculus

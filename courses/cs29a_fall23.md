# Lesson Notes
We will provide notes on each lesson below.

## Lesson 1 Thu 8/31/2023  _Intro and overview_
* We begin with
  - an overview of the course and
  - a discussion of why Math might be useful in CS, and what kinds of math would be most useful
* We ask everyhone to connect to the [Mastery Learning App](https://mastery.cs.brandeis.edu) with PIN 5074577
* We introduce Boolean Algebra and the Propositional Calculus  
  - We introduce the boolean operators AND, OR, NOT, IMPLIES, IFF, XOR, ONLYIF
    https://github.com/tjhickey724/discrete_math/blob/main/notes/propositional_calculus/overview.md
  - We also show how to create Truth Tables from Boolean formulas, i.e. sentences in the Propositional Calculus
  https://github.com/tjhickey724/discrete_math/blob/main/notes/propositional_calculus/TruthTablePractice.md
  - We get some practice in converting between English and the Propoaitional Calculus
  https://github.com/tjhickey724/discrete_math/blob/main/notes/propositional_calculus/PropCalTranslation.md


## Lesson 2 Wed 9/6/2023 __Propositional Calculus and Boolean Algebra__
* We begin with a review of the syntax of formulas in the propositional calculus
  https://github.com/tjhickey724/discrete_math/blob/main/notes/propositional_calculus/overview.md
* Next we get more practice converting propositional calculus to English and vice versa.
  https://github.com/tjhickey724/discrete_math/blob/main/notes/propositional_calculus/PropCalTranslation.md
* Next we show how to find the value of a propositional formula for particular values of its variables
  To do this we need to create a parse tree for the formula, and then use that tree to evaluate the formula
  https://github.com/tjhickey724/discrete_math/blob/main/notes/propositional_calculus/PropCalcParseTree.md



## Lesson 3 Thu 9/7/2023 - Truth Tables and Inference
* We show how to create a Truth Table for a formula, this shows its value for all possible interpretations of its variables.
  https://github.com/tjhickey724/discrete_math/blob/main/notes/propositional_calculus/TruthTables.md
  and we see a few more examples of truth tables
  https://github.com/tjhickey724/discrete_math/blob/main/notes/propositional_calculus/TruthTablePractice.md
* We also show how to use a Parse Tree to evalaute a Boolean formula on an interpretation
   https://github.com/tjhickey724/discrete_math/blob/main/notes/propositional_calculus/PropCalcParseTree.md
* We review the inference rules for Propositional Logic
* and we show that every formula can be reduced to
  [Disjunctive Normal Form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjunctive_normal_form)

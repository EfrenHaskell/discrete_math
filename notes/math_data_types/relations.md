# Binary Relations

A binary relation $R$ consists of
* a set $A$, called the domain of $R$ and
* a set $B$ called the codomain of $R$, and
* a subset of $A\times B$ called the graph of $R$

We can think of a relation $R$ as defining a multi-valued partial function $f_R$
by 
* $f_R(x) = \\{y\in B |\ xRy \\}$

A good example is the squareroot relation 
* $x S y \equiv (x = y^2)$ 

this corresponds to the square root function 
* $y = \sqrt{x}$ 

which is only defined for $x\ge 0$.
If $x=0$ it has one value $\\{{0\\}$
and if $x\gt 0$ it has two values the positive square root and the negative square root!
* $f_S(1) = \\{-1,1\\}$
* $f_S(-1) = \\{\\}$
* $f_S(0) = \\{0\\}$
* $f_S(2) = \\{\sqrt{2},-\sqrt{2}\\}$

# Functions
A function $f$ is an associations of elements in one set $A$ called the domain of f to elements in another set $B$ called the codomain of f
and is written:

$f: A \rightarrow  B$

The element $b$ of $B$ that a function $f$ associates to an element $a$ of $A$ is denoted $f(a)$.

A function is a **total function** if it assigns a value to every element of its domain, otherwise it is a **partial function**.

Functions can be defined in many ways. For example,
1. By listing its values on domain elements, e.g. $f(0)=TRUE, f(1)=FALSE$
2. By giving an expression to evaluate $f(x) = x + (1/x)$
3. By explaining the association in words $f(n)$ is the $n$ prime number, for natural numbers $n\gt 0$
4. By giving a menu style definition

$$
f(p)=
\left\\{
\begin{array}{ll}
p &\text{if }p\gt 0 \\ 
-p &\text{otherwise}.
\end{array} 
\right.
$$

# Sequences

A sequence is a list of elements from a set.
We will write them inside parentheses, separated by commas, as so

* (2,7,1,8,2,8)  is a sequence of six digits
* (apple, cherry, banana) is a sequence of 3 strings of characters (or three fruits)
* $(1,3,5,7,9,11,13,\ldots)$  = the infinite sequence of odd numbers
* $(1,4,1,4,2,\ldots)$ = the infinite sequence of digits of the square root of 2

## Products of Sets
The product of sets $S_1,\ldots,S_n$ is written
* $S_1\times S_2 \times \ldots \times S_n$

and is defined as the set of all length n sequences $(s_1,s_2,\ldots,s_n)$ with $s_i\in S_i$ for each $i$.

The product of $S$ with itself $n$ times is written $S^n$

For example if $A=\\{0,1\\}$ then the elements of $A^2$ are
* $\\{(0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(1,1)\\}$

if $B=\\{T,F\\}$ then the elements of $A\times B$ are
* $\\{(0,F),(0,T),(1,F),(1,T)\\}$

## Exercise 1
1. Describe in English the set $A = \mathbb{N}\times \\{0,1\\}$ and list a few members of this set
2. Let $B=\\{0,1\\}$, list the elements of the set $C$ defined by $C=B\\times{\cal P}(B)$
    where ${\cal P}(B) = 2^B$ is the powerset of B.
3. List the elements of the set $D = \\{(a,s)\in C | a \in s\\}$

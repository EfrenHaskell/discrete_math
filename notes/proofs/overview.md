# The Art of Writing Mathematical Proofs
In this unit we discuss different proof techniques
and practice using these techniques to create clear and convincing arguments
of the truth of mathematical statements. These are fundamental skills for
Computer Scientists as there are many cases where we want to clearly explain why
our algorithms and programs are correct and efficient, and the best way to do that is with a
well-designed proof.

There are usually many different ways we prove that an argument is valid.
We have seen that there are formal methods for proving validity, but these quickly
become too messy and complex when trying to prove interesting propositions, so we
will focus on "informal" proofs.

We will learn how to use the following proof techniques:
* direct proof - show that the conclusion follows from the premises by direct application of the premises
* proof by contradiction - assuming that the conclusion is false and using  the premises to generate a contradiction, which shows the conclusion can not be false
* proof by cases - showing that a1->c and a2->c and ... and an->c and at least one of a1, a2,...., an must be true.

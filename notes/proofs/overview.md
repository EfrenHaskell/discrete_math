# Proof Techniques
In this unit we discuss different proof techniques
and practice using these techniques to create clear and convincing arguments
of the truth of mathematical statements. These are fundamental skills for
Computer Scientists as there are many cases where we want to clearly explain why
our programs are correct and efficient, and the best way to do that is with a
well-designed proof.

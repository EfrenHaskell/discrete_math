# Analysis of Algorithms

In this section we give an overview of techniques for analyzing the performance of algorithms.

## Big-Oh, Big-Omega, and Big-Theta notation
The first step is to define some families of functions that we use to classify algorithms by their
performance...  Rather than find the exact time a program will take we want a rough classification
that allows us to compare different programs and we're especially interested on large data inputs
and not too interested on the speed of the particular computer... This leads naturally to these three
sets...

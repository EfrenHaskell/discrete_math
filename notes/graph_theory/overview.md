# Overview of Graph Theory

## Basic Definitions
A **directed graph (or digraph)** $G$ is a pair $(V,E)$ where $V$ is a set of vertices or nodes, and $E$ is a subset of $V \times V$ called the edges of $G$.
We can draw a 2d visual representation of a graph by plotting each of the points $v$ of $V$ as distinct point $p(v)$ on the x-y plane and then
for each edge $(a,b)$ in $E$ draw a line between the points $p(a)$ and $p(b)$, usually with an arrow at the end point to $b$. 

We say that the the edge $d=(a,b)$ goes from $a$ to $b$,
* $a$ is the tail of $e$
* $b$ is the head of $b$

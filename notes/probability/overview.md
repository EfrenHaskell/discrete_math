# Overview of Probability

Probability is the science of determining how likely some particular occurence will be.
We use probability in many different fields of Computer Science, from algorithm design and analysis,
to network analysis, to user interface design, to computational linguistics, to machine learning, and more.
In this section we will give an overview of some of the core concepts needed to reason rigorously and
effectively about probability.

We begin with the [Four Step Method](fourstepmethod.md) which is a methdology for calculating
probabilities in a wide variety of situations.

Then we look at [Probability Spaces](probability_spaces.md) and the corresponding concepts of random variables
and expected values and indepence of events and variables.

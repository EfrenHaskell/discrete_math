# Probability Spaces

## Definitions
A **Sample Space** is countable set S (finite or infinite)
* the elements of a sample space $S$ are called **outcomes**
* a subset of S is called an **event**


A **Probability Function** on a sample space $S$E is a total function ${\rm Pr}:S\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$
  from $S$ to the real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ such that 
* ${\rm Pr}[\omega]\ge 0$ for all $\omega \in S$
* $\sum_\limits{\omega in S} {\rm Pr}[\omega] = 1$

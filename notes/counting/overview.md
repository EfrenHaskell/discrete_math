# Overview of Combinatorics
Counting the number of elements in a particular family of sets is an important topic in Discrete Math.

In Computer Science, counting is often needed when we are trying to analyze the performance of an algorithm
and it is used when estimating probabilities (e.g. the probability some particular segment of code will be run).

In this course we will cover several different counting techniques which can be classified by how the sets
are constructed
* [basic counting](https://github.com/tjhickey724/discrete_math/blob/main/notes/counting/basicCounting.md) i.e. counting disjoint unions, products, powersets, ...
* [counting permutations and combinations](https://github.com/tjhickey724/discrete_math/blob/main/notes/counting/permsAndCombs.md) choosing size k subsets or sequences from a set of size n
* [multisets](./multisets.md) also known as "Stars and Bars" counting
* [the pigeonhole principle](pigeonhole.md)


Here is a [summary of the counting methods](summary.md)

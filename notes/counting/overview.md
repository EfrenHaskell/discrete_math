# Overview of Combinatorics
Counting the number of elements in a particular family of sets is an important topic in Discrete Math.

In Computer Science, counting is often needed when we are trying to analyze the performance of an algorithm
and it is used when estimating probabilities (e.g. the probability some particular segment of code will be run).

In this course we will cover several different counting techniques which can be classified by how the sets
are constructed
* counting disjoint unions, products, powersets, and ranges of a function
* counting subsets and permutations

We'll also look at applications of counting such as the Pigeonhole principle.

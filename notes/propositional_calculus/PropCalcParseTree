# Propositional Calculus Parse Trees

For large sentences in the propositional calculus, also known as boolean formulas, it can sometimes be easier to
represent the formula in a graphical form as a "tree".  This is particularly useful if you want to evaluate a formula
on a particular assignment of truth values to the variables of the formula.

## Example

Below is an example of a parse tree for the formula
 $(P \rightarrow R) \wedge(Q\rightarrow R)) \leftrightarrow (P\vee Q \rightarrow R)$

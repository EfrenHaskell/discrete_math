# Inference Rules for Propositional Calculus

We say that two formulas $F_1$ and $F_2$ are equivalent, writted $F_1\equiv F_2$ if they
hae the same values on all interpretations.

We can think of the Propositional Calculus as a kind of Algebra (called Boolean Algebra)
and we can apply operations on these formula that are very similar to the standard operations
in arithmetic. This page has some of the most common operation and they can easily be verified
to be correct by calculating their truth tables.

| Rule Name | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| Double Negation | $\neg \neg A \equiv A$ |
| DeMorgan's Law | $\neg (A \vee B) \equiv \neg A \wedge \neg B$ |
| DeMorgan's Law | $\neg (A \wedge B) \equiv \neg A \vee \neg B$ |
| Distributive Law | $A \vee (B \wedge C) \equiv (A\vee B) \wedge (A\vee C)$|

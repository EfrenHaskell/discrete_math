# Applications of Sequences

The techniques we've used for solving recursive equations have many applications in Computer Science.
In this note, we will show how a variation of the fibonacci sequence has applications in finding the
performance of certain algorithms for quickly storing and looking up data.

A full binary tree of height h is a tree in which every node has exactly two children and the every leaf
has exactly h+1 ancestors.

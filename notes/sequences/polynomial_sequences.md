# Polynomial Sequences

Polynomial sequences have the form $s_n = p(n)$ where $p$ is a polynomial,
e.g. 
* if $p(x)=2x+1$, then $s = (1,3,5,7,9,...)$ is the odd numbers
* if $p(x) = x^2$ then $s = (0,1,4,9,16,25, ...)$ is the sequence of square numbers
* if $p(x) = x(x+1)/2$ then $s=(0,1,3,6,10, \ldots)$ is the triangle numbers
